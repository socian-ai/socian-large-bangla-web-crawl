### Description
A corpus of 3 million webpages crawled from Bangladeshi sites. It contains 180 million Bangla words and 500,000 unique words. Sites include all news portals, blogs and some other popular Bangladeshi sites. It enables researchers to find trends, analyze particular event's presence, train artificial intelligence powered systems for unsupervised training etc. The possibilities are limitless. 

### Data Fromat
The corpus is released in very popular Common Crawl WARC format, making it very easy for any researcher to use already publicly available tools for Common Crawl WARC format. 

### Size
